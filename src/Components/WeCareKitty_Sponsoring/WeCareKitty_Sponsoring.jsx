    <p className='text-white'>Another area of focus for the Archie Foundation will be to sponsor and uplift small villages in third-world countries. We will partner with NGOs to educate villages, build up small-scale industries in these villages to create jobs to help keep the population from migrating to the congested bigger cities. The foundation will look into partnerships with government and non- governmental agencies in order to meet the energy and internet connectivity needs in these villages, which we think will open up opportunities in a self-sustaining manner.
