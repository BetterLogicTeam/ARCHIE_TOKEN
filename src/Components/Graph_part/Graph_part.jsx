                  What is ArchieToken? Archie Token on our All-New ARC chain
                  will be the ultimate winning combination for our holders. We
                  have listened to enough so-called crypto specialists and lost
                  enough. Now it is time for us to be the winners. 2023 is going
                  to be a real sketchy year to be in crypto based on the market
                  conditions and news coming out. But we have the right recipe
                  and ingredients to make it happen. We are not promising
                  millionaires, but you wonâ€™t lose your money. That is always
                  our motto at ArchieNeko.

                  Why are we creating a token on ARC chain while we have a token
                  on Erc-20 already?
                </p>
                <p className="text-start text-white">
                  This is a valid question that came up several times. When we
                  launched our original token, the Eth was at $3,250 and we
                  changed our plans to not to list our token in any centralized
                  exchange. Not only that, our tokenomics were set at 15% on buy
                  and 20% sell to stop the hop in hop out system in crypto
                  industry. Our intensions were good, but the market did not do
                  good and Ethereum went down to $800. Our anti whale mechanism
                  prevented people to ape in and out but also prevented us from
                  further growth.

            <p className="text-white">Tokenomics are very much needed for a project to succeed. When we were thinking about setting up a tokenomics for our new project, we have taken lots of things in consideration including the mistakes we have made on our original token.
We need to support our liquidity and of course ,our marketing needs. So, we decided to have the very minimal on two categories. In addition to that, we have separated transfer tax from sell and made it lower since lots of our holders were concerned about that.</p>
        <p className="text-white">We will have two different tokenomics : Initial First Month and Regular after First Month</p>
